          The objective of the course project was to provide us with an opportunity to explore more topics, functionalities, design patterns, UI design, sensor interaction and hardware features on the Android mobile framework. We designed and implemented an application that used multiple mobile device features in an interesting and useful way.

          GrocerEasy is a utility-based shopping to-do list app where you can create various shopping lists. Users can create multiple lists in which they will be able to add the items they want to purchase when they go to the store and keep track of the items they have checked off. The app features GPS to detect when the user is near an area that the user has set a GPS reminder and give a friendly reminder to the user to buy the items from the list they set the reminder for. GrocerEasy also takes advantage of an accelerometer sensor that, when the user shakes the phone, opens a new activity depending on which screen they are on.

        The first step for this project was to come up with an idea that fulfilled the project criteria which included the following:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>At least three activities </li>
        <li>Implicit intents and explicit intents </li>
        <li>Storing data in both preferences and SQLite database which would be local to the app</li>
        <li>Accessing the hardware of the device (for example: battery status, sensors) </li>
        <li>Camera or GPS functionality </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I played around with a few ideas, but in the end settled for a grocery shopping to-do list app. I got the idea by observing my mother making shopping lists for herself and forgetting to get the items on her lists. I followed up by looking on the app store to find a similar app targeting grocery shopping and GPS reminders and did not find an app which was made for this purpose. I made sure that the app would meet all the requirements for the project, made my initial sitemap for the application, and a timeline to follow and stay on track to meet the deadline.

    </div>

      <p>
        After I began working on the code, I started to see some things that I wanted to change for the application. Originally, the app would have at least three activities such as creating lists, GPS alerts, and adding item favorites to a favorites page. There would be explicit intents to change from one activity screen to another such as going from the main menu page to the “create a list” activity page. Implicit intents would have the app set sound alerts to the user when they are near a store. The app would have data storage local to the app in both preferences and SQLite to store lists, favorites, and reminders. Lastly, it would access the phones hardware such as GPS to track the users’ location, and access the battery status of the phone to turn off GPS when the battery got low.

      <h4>Design complexity</h4>
      <p>
        The biggest challenge was to make a logo that would emulate the idea of the research branch, but also not be overly complex in the design. At first, I tackled the problem by trying to make it much too simple, which was not eye-catching at all. It took a few ideations before I created two different logos that were both similar to each other but still had their own unique look.

  <h3>Learning and Insights</h3>

      <p>
        I learned a fair amount about how to work with a client. When I would think the logo design was good, they asked for more and it pushed me to create something better than I originally had in mind. In the end this project was all about making the client happy with the final design and keeping an open mind to what would be best for the logo.
